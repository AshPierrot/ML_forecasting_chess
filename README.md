This code works with a database of chess matches (a sample of over 20,000 games) to predict victory.
I saw a competition on Kaggle and, although I didnâ€™t participate, I created a model for myself.
Its explanatory power - F1 measure, shows the quality of the model at 0.45 on the training group and 0.47 on the test group, respectively.
It is clear that predicting victory in a chess game is incredibly difficult, but interesting.
The distribution of games by rating is close to normal, which allows you to work with data using unique mathematical statistics tools
